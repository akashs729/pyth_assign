Values and types

A value is one of the basic things a program works with, like a letter or a number. 
These values belong to different types: 2 is an integer, and “Hello, World!” is a
string, so called because it contains a “string” of letters. You (and the interpreter)
can identify strings because they are enclosed in quotation marks.
